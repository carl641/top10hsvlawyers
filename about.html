    <!-- How We Select -->
    <section class="section section-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How Lawyers Are Selected for Our List</h2>
        <p>Being featured on Top 10 Huntsville Lawyers is not something that can be purchased. Our selection process is rooted in objective research and a genuine commitment to serving the Huntsville, Madison County, and North Alabama community. Here is how we identify and rank the top attorneys:</p>

        <div class="practice-areas-grid" style="margin-top:30px;">
          <div class="practice-area-card">
            <h3>1. Initial Research</h3>
            <p>We begin by surveying the full landscape of practicing attorneys in Huntsville and Madison County. We review public records, Alabama State Bar membership listings, and local court filings to identify active lawyers across all major practice areas in North Alabama.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="practice-area-card">
            <h3>2. Credential Verification</h3>
            <p>Every attorney under consideration must be in good standing with the Alabama State Bar. We verify bar admissions, check for any disciplinary history, and confirm that each lawyer is actively licensed to practice in Huntsville and throughout the state of Alabama.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="practice-area-card">
            <h3>3. Experience Assessment</h3>
            <p>We evaluate each attorney's years of practice, the types of cases they have handled, their track record with outcomes in Madison County courts, and whether they have specialized expertise relevant to the Huntsville and North Alabama legal market.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="practice-area-card">
            <h3>4. Client &amp; Peer Reviews</h3>
            <p>Client feedback is central to our evaluation. We analyze reviews from multiple platforms&mdash;including Google, Avvo, and the Better Business Bureau&mdash;and consider peer endorsements from other Huntsville and Madison County attorneys to gauge each lawyer's reputation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="practice-area-card">
            <h3>5. Professional Recognition</h3>
            <p>We look for awards and honors such as Super Lawyers designations, Best Lawyers in America selections, Martindale-Hubbell AV Preeminent ratings, and other recognitions that reflect a lawyer's standing within the Huntsville legal community and beyond.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="practice-area-card">
            <h3>6. Community Involvement</h3>
            <p>Attorneys who give back to Huntsville, Madison County, and North Alabama through pro bono work, community organizations, the Huntsville-Madison County Bar Association, and local civic involvement receive additional consideration in our rankings.</p>

    <!-- Evaluation Criteria -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Our Evaluation Criteria in Detail</h2>
        <p>Transparency is important to us. Below is a detailed breakdown of the criteria we use when evaluating attorneys for inclusion on our Top 10 list for Huntsville, Alabama:</p>

        <div style="max-width:800px;margin:30px auto;">
          <h3>Legal Experience &amp; Track Record</h3>
          <p>We examine each attorney's total years of practice, their case history in Huntsville and Madison County courts, the complexity of cases they have handled, and their success rates. Lawyers who have demonstrated consistent, positive outcomes for clients in the North Alabama area receive the highest marks in this category.</p>

          <h3>Client Satisfaction &amp; Reviews</h3>
          <p>Real client experiences matter. We compile and analyze reviews from verified clients, looking at overall satisfaction, communication quality, responsiveness, and how effectively each attorney resolved their clients' legal issues in Huntsville and the surrounding communities.</p>

          <h3>Professional Achievements &amp; Awards</h3>
          <p>Recognition from respected legal organizations carries significant weight. We track Super Lawyers selections, Best Lawyers listings, Martindale-Hubbell peer review ratings, Alabama State Bar leadership roles, and other professional honors earned by attorneys serving the Huntsville area.</p>

          <h3>Ethical Standing &amp; Bar Status</h3>
          <p>Every attorney on our list must maintain an impeccable ethical record with the Alabama State Bar. We review disciplinary records, malpractice history, and overall professional conduct. Only attorneys with clean records and good standing are considered for our Huntsville rankings.</p>

          <h3>Accessibility &amp; Client Service</h3>
          <p>We evaluate how easy it is for Huntsville and Madison County residents to access each attorney. Factors include office locations in or near Huntsville, availability for consultations, responsiveness to inquiries, fee transparency, and whether the attorney offers flexible scheduling for North Alabama clients.</p>

          <h3>Specialization &amp; Practice Focus</h3>
          <p>Attorneys who demonstrate deep expertise in their practice areas&mdash;rather than generalists who spread themselves thin&mdash;tend to rank higher. We value lawyers who are recognized authorities in specific areas of law within the Huntsville and North Alabama legal community.</p>
