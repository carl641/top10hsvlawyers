          <h2>About Ralph W. Hornsby Jr.</h2>
          <p>Ralph W. Hornsby Jr. stands as one of the most experienced and accomplished personal injury attorneys in North Alabama. With more than 30 years of legal practice, Ralph has dedicated his career to representing individuals and families in Huntsville, Madison County, and communities throughout the Tennessee Valley who have been harmed by the negligence of others. As a partner at Hornsby, Watson &amp; Hornsby, he leads a firm that has become synonymous with aggressive, effective advocacy for injury victims across Alabama.</p>
          <p>Throughout his three decades of practice in Huntsville, Ralph has developed a particular expertise in nursing home abuse and neglect cases. He recognized early in his career that some of the most vulnerable members of the North Alabama community&mdash;elderly residents in long-term care facilities&mdash;were suffering in silence. Since then, he has become a leading voice in holding nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and their corporate owners accountable when they fail to provide adequate care to residents in Madison County and beyond.</p>
          <p>Ralph's approach to the practice of law is deeply personal. He believes that every client who walks into his Huntsville office deserves to be heard, respected, and represented with the full force of his experience and resources. Whether handling a complex trucking accident case on Interstate 565 or investigating patterns of neglect at a North Alabama nursing facility, Ralph brings the same level of dedication, thoroughness, and tenacity that has defined his career for over three decades.</p>
