            <h2>About Frank Ward</h2>
            <p>Frank Ward is a formidable criminal defense and DUI attorney who has been protecting the rights of the accused in Huntsville, Alabama, for more than 18 years. As the founder of Frank Ward Law, he has established himself as one of the most experienced and effective defense lawyers operating in Madison County and throughout North Alabama. His practice is built on a straightforward philosophy: every person charged with a crime deserves aggressive, knowledgeable legal representation, regardless of the severity of the allegations against them.</p>

            <p>Criminal charges can upend a person's life in an instant. A DUI arrest on Memorial Parkway, a drug possession charge following a traffic stop in Madison County, or a felony indictment in the Madison County Circuit Court can carry consequences that extend far beyond fines and jail time. Loss of driving privileges, damage to professional reputation, employment difficulties, and strained family relationships are just some of the collateral effects that criminal defendants in Huntsville face. Frank Ward understands the gravity of these situations and works tirelessly to minimize the impact on his clients' lives.</p>

            <p>Frank's depth of experience in the Huntsville criminal court system gives him a significant strategic advantage. He has tried cases before virtually every judge in Madison County, and he has built professional relationships with prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and court personnel throughout the jurisdiction. This familiarity with the local legal landscape allows him to anticipate the prosecution's strategies, identify weaknesses in the state's evidence, and negotiate effectively on behalf of his clients. When a case demands it, Frank is equally prepared to take it to trial and fight for an acquittal before a Madison County jury.</p>

            <h2>Practice Areas</h2>
            <p>Frank Ward focuses his practice exclusively on <a href="../practice-areas/criminal-defense.html">criminal defense</a> and <a href="../practice-areas/dui-defense.html">DUI defense</a>, providing concentrated expertise in the following areas throughout Huntsville and North Alabama:</p>

              <li><strong>Drug Crimes:</strong> Possession of controlled substances, possession with intent to distribute, drug trafficking, marijuana offenses, and prescription drug charges in Madison County and throughout the Northern District of Alabama.</li>

            <p>Frank Ward has achieved notable results in DUI and criminal defense cases throughout Huntsville and Madison County. While every case is different and past results do not guarantee future outcomes, these examples demonstrate his courtroom effectiveness:</p>
            <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
              <li>Obtained a full dismissal of a felony DUI charge in Madison County after successfully challenging the admissibility of the defendant's blood alcohol test results, demonstrating that proper chain-of-custody procedures were not followed by the arresting agency.</li>
              <li>Secured a not-guilty verdict in a Huntsville Municipal Court DUI trial by demonstrating through expert testimony that field sobriety tests were administered improperly during a late-night traffic stop on University Drive.</li>
              <li>Negotiated a reduction from a felony drug possession charge to a misdemeanor with a pre-trial diversion program for a first-time offender in Madison County, preserving the client's clean record upon successful completion of the program.</li>
              <li>Won an acquittal in a Madison County Circuit Court jury trial on charges of second-degree assault, successfully arguing self-defense on behalf of a Huntsville resident.</li>
              <li>Successfully obtained expungement of a prior criminal record for a North Alabama professional, allowing the client to pursue career advancement without the burden of a past conviction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Client Testimonial</h2>
            <div class="testimonial">
              <p>"I was arrested for DUI in Madison County and was terrified about losing my license and my job. Frank Ward was recommended to me by a friend, and hiring him was the best decision I could have made. He found problems with the traffic stop itself and challenged the breathalyzer results. Ultimately, the charges were reduced significantly, and I was able to keep my driving privileges. Frank knows the Huntsville court system inside and out. He is straightforward, does not sugarcoat anything, and fights hard for his clients. I would recommend him to anyone facing criminal charges in North Alabama."</p>
