          <h2>About Jeffrey G. Blackwell</h2>
          <p>Jeffrey G. Blackwell has spent more than 22 years fighting for the rights of injured workers and accident victims in Huntsville, Alabama. As a named partner at Crumbley-Blackwell-Price, Jeffrey has established himself as one of the leading workers' compensation and personal injury attorneys in the North Alabama region. His deep knowledge of Alabama's workers' compensation system, combined with his trial-ready approach to litigation, has made him a go-to advocate for working people throughout Madison County who have been hurt on the job.</p>
          <p>Huntsville's economy is anchored by the defense, aerospace, and technology industries, with thousands of workers employed at Redstone Arsenal, the Marshall Space Flight Center, Cummings Research Park, and the numerous manufacturing and construction operations that serve the region. Jeffrey understands the unique workplace hazards that Huntsville-area employees face, from industrial plant accidents and construction site injuries to repetitive stress conditions common among technology workers. This specialized knowledge allows him to effectively advocate for clients across a wide range of occupational injury cases.</p>
          <p>Jeffrey's philosophy is straightforward: when an employer or insurance company fails to provide the benefits and compensation that an injured worker in Madison County is legally entitled to, he will do whatever it takes to make things right. He has built Crumbley-Blackwell-Price's workers' compensation practice into one of the most respected in North Alabama by consistently delivering results and treating every client's case with the seriousness it deserves.</p>

          <h2>Practice Areas</h2>
          <p>Jeffrey G. Blackwell represents injured workers and accident victims throughout Huntsville, Madison County, and the North Alabama region. His practice is focused on the following areas:</p>
          <ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:25px; margin:15px 0;">
            <li><strong><a href="../practice-areas/workers-compensation.html">Workers' Compensation</a></strong> &mdash; Representing employees in Huntsville and across North Alabama in claims for workplace injuries, including disputes over benefits, denied claims, and employer retaliation</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Accident Injuries</strong> &mdash; Handling claims arising from falls, equipment failures, electrocutions, and other hazards on construction sites throughout Madison County</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial &amp; Manufacturing Injuries</strong> &mdash; Advocating for workers injured in Huntsville-area plants, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities due to unsafe conditions or equipment malfunctions</li>
            <li><strong><a href="../practice-areas/personal-injury.html">Personal Injury</a></strong> &mdash; Pursuing compensation for victims of automobile accidents, slip-and-fall incidents, and other negligence-based injuries in North Alabama</li>
            <li><strong>Occupational Disease Claims</strong> &mdash; Representing workers in Madison County who have developed illnesses such as respiratory conditions, hearing loss, or chemical exposure injuries as a result of their employment</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Workplace Injury Claims</strong> &mdash; Filing lawsuits against equipment manufacturers, subcontractors, and other third parties whose negligence contributed to a workplace injury in the Huntsville area</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Alabama's workers' compensation laws can be complex and heavily favor employers and insurance companies. Jeffrey's 22 years of experience navigating this system in Madison County courtrooms means he knows exactly how to counter the tactics that insurers use to deny or minimize legitimate claims. His clients benefit from an attorney who has seen every strategy in the book and knows how to overcome each one.</p>

          <ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:25px; margin:15px 0;">

            <li><strong>Court Admissions</strong> &mdash; All Alabama State Courts; U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama</li>
            <li><strong>Continuing Legal Education</strong> &mdash; Annual participation in workers' compensation and personal injury CLE programs throughout Alabama</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Jeffrey earned his Juris Doctor from Cumberland School of Law at Samford University, one of the oldest and most respected law schools in Alabama. His legal education emphasized practical trial skills and civil litigation, providing the foundation for the courtroom advocacy that has defined his career in Huntsville. Cumberland's rigorous curriculum prepared Jeffrey for the demands of workers' compensation litigation, where the intersection of medical evidence, employment law, and insurance regulations requires both breadth and depth of legal knowledge.</p>

          <h2>Client Testimonial</h2>
          <div class="testimonial">
            <p>"I was injured on a construction site in Huntsville and my employer's insurance company denied my workers' comp claim, saying my injury wasn't work-related. I was out of work, in pain, and didn't know how I was going to support my family. Jeffrey Blackwell took my case and immediately went to work gathering evidence and building my claim. He was straightforward with me about the process, kept me informed at every step, and ultimately got my benefits reinstated plus additional compensation for my injuries. He genuinely cares about the working people in this community. I would recommend him to anyone who has been hurt on the job in Madison County."</p>
