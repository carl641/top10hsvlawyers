            <h2>About Sarah S. Shepard</h2>
            <p>Sarah S. Shepard is a highly regarded estate planning and probate attorney serving Huntsville, Alabama, and families throughout the North Alabama region.

Her thoughtful, detail-oriented approach to estate planning has made her one of the most trusted attorneys in Huntsville for matters involving wills, trusts, and estate administration.</p>

            <p>Huntsville's population has grown rapidly, and with that growth has come a diverse and increasingly affluent community of professionals, business owners, military families, and retirees who need sophisticated estate planning solutions.
