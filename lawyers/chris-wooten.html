          <h2>About Chris Wooten</h2>
          <p>Chris Wooten is one of Huntsville's most respected medical malpractice attorneys, bringing more than 16 years of dedicated legal experience to every case he handles. As the founder of Wooten Law, Chris has built a reputation throughout Madison County and the broader North Alabama region for his relentless pursuit of justice on behalf of patients who have suffered harm due to medical negligence. His practice is grounded in a deep understanding of both the legal and medical complexities that define malpractice litigation in Alabama.</p>
          <p>From his office in Huntsville, Chris serves clients across North Alabama, including families in Madison, Limestone, Morgan, and Marshall Counties. He understands the challenges that injured patients face when going up against hospitals, insurance companies, and large healthcare systems. His approach combines thorough case investigation with compassionate client service, ensuring that every individual who walks through his door receives personalized attention and a clear understanding of their legal options.</p>
          <p>Chris chose to focus his career on medical malpractice because he believes that healthcare providers must be held to the highest standard of care. When a physician, surgeon, nurse, or hospital fails to meet that standard and a patient suffers as a result, Chris works tirelessly to ensure that the responsible parties are held accountable. His track record of successful outcomes in Huntsville and throughout Alabama speaks to his skill in navigating these complex cases from initial investigation through trial if necessary.</p>
