        <p class="text-center" style="max-width:750px;margin:0 auto 10px;">Our ranking methodology is designed to be transparent, data-driven, and independent. No attorney can pay to be included on our list. Below is a detailed explanation of exactly how we evaluate and rank lawyers for our 2025 edition.</p>
        <p class="text-center" style="font-size:0.9rem;color:var(--color-text-light);">Last updated: January 15, 2025 &bull; Next scheduled review: July 2025</p>

        <h2>Research Scope &amp; Process Overview</h2>
        <p>For our 2025 edition, our editorial team conducted a comprehensive review of the Huntsville, Alabama legal market. Here is a summary of the scope of our research:</p>

        <div class="stats-row" style="margin:30px 0;">
          <div class="stat-item">
            <div class="stat-number">50+</div>
            <div class="stat-label">Law Firms Reviewed</div>
          </div>

            <div class="stat-label">Evaluation Criteria</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Our process begins with a broad survey of all actively licensed attorneys in Madison County and the greater Huntsville area. We use publicly available data from the Alabama State Bar, Madison County court records, and legal directories to build an initial list of candidates. From there, we apply our multi-factor evaluation criteria to narrow the field to 10 attorneys who represent the highest standards of legal practice in the region.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Alabama State Bar Verification</h2>
        <p>Every attorney considered for our list must be in good standing with the Alabama State Bar. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite. We verify:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>Active license status:</strong> The attorney must hold an active, unrestricted license to practice law in the State of Alabama.</li>
          <li><strong>Disciplinary history:</strong> We review the Alabama State Bar's public discipline records. Any attorney with a history of public reprimand, suspension, or disbarment is automatically disqualified.</li>
          <li><strong>Bar membership duration:</strong> We note how long the attorney has been admitted to the Alabama State Bar, which serves as a baseline indicator of experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Specialty certifications:</strong> If the attorney holds board certifications or has completed advanced legal education programs, this is noted as a positive factor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Multi-Platform Client Review Analysis</h2>
        <p>Client feedback is a critical component of our evaluation. Rather than relying on a single source, we aggregate and analyze reviews from three independent platforms:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>Google Reviews:</strong> We analyze each attorney's Google Business Profile reviews, looking at overall star rating, total number of reviews, recency of reviews, and the substance of detailed feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Avvo:</strong> We review Avvo ratings (1&ndash;10 scale), Avvo-published client reviews, and the attorney's Avvo profile completeness (endorsements, experience entries, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Better Business Bureau (BBB):</strong> For attorneys and law firms with BBB profiles, we review complaint history, resolution records, and accreditation status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We look for patterns across all three platforms. An attorney with consistently positive reviews on multiple platforms carries more weight than one with high ratings on just a single site. We also flag reviews that appear inauthentic or incentivized.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Professional Recognition &amp; Peer Review</h2>
        <p>We cross-reference each attorney's profile with major legal recognition programs. These peer-reviewed designations carry significant weight because they reflect the opinions of other practicing attorneys&mdash;not just clients:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>Super Lawyers:</strong> Selection is based on independent research, peer nominations, and peer evaluations. We note whether the attorney has received a Super Lawyers or Rising Stars designation.</li>
          <li><strong>Best Lawyers in America:</strong> Selection is based entirely on peer review. We check for current and historical listings.</li>
          <li><strong>Martindale-Hubbell:</strong> We look for AV Preeminent ratings, which represent the highest level of professional excellence as rated by peers and the judiciary.</li>
          <li><strong>Other recognitions:</strong> State bar leadership roles, Alabama Super Lawyers Magazine features, and local awards from the Huntsville-Madison County Bar Association are also considered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Madison County Court Experience</h2>
        <p>Because our directory focuses specifically on Huntsville and Madison County, we place significant emphasis on local court experience. An attorney with a strong national profile but no presence in local courts would not rank as highly as one who regularly practices before Madison County judges. We evaluate:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>Madison County Circuit Court:</strong> Frequency of appearances and case handling in the county's primary trial court.</li>
          <li><strong>Madison County District Court:</strong> Experience with misdemeanor, small claims, and preliminary hearing matters.</li>
          <li><strong>Northern District of Alabama (Federal):</strong> Federal court admission and experience, particularly in the Northeastern Division serving Huntsville.</li>
          <li><strong>Alabama appellate courts:</strong> Experience before the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals, Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Supreme Court of Alabama.</li>
          <li><strong>Local legal community involvement:</strong> Membership in the Huntsville-Madison County Bar Association, pro bono work with local legal aid organizations, and civic involvement in the Huntsville community.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 5: Practice Area Depth Assessment</h2>
        <p>We evaluate whether each attorney demonstrates genuine expertise in their claimed practice areas, rather than functioning as a generalist. Factors include:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>Years of concentrated practice:</strong> How long has the attorney focused on their stated specialty?</li>
          <li><strong>Case complexity:</strong> Has the attorney handled complex cases within their specialty, such as high-asset divorce, multi-party personal injury, or federal criminal defense?</li>
          <li><strong>Continuing legal education:</strong> Has the attorney pursued advanced training, certifications, or teaching roles within their practice area?</li>
          <li><strong>Published work:</strong> Has the attorney published articles, given CLE presentations, or been quoted as an expert in their field?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 6: Community Involvement &amp; Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Our final evaluation criterion looks at how accessible and community-oriented each attorney is. This includes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>Pro bono work:</strong> Participation in the Madison County Volunteer Lawyers Program or other legal aid initiatives serving low-income Huntsville residents.</li>
          <li><strong>Community organizations:</strong> Involvement with local organizations such as the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce, United Way of Madison County, or other civic groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Consultation availability:</strong> Whether the attorney offers free or low-cost initial consultations to help potential clients understand their legal options.</li>
          <li><strong>Office accessibility:</strong> Whether the attorney maintains a physical office in or near Huntsville that is accessible to Madison County residents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Score &amp; Rank</h2>
        <p>Each of the six criteria above contributes to an overall evaluation score. The criteria are weighted as follows:</p>

        <table class="info-table" style="margin:20px 0;">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Criterion</th>
              <th>Weight</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Alabama State Bar Standing &amp; Credentials</td>
              <td>Pass/Fail (Prerequisite)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Multi-Platform Client Reviews</td>
              <td>30%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Professional Recognition &amp; Peer Review</td>
              <td>25%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Local Court Experience</td>
              <td>20%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Practice Area Depth</td>
              <td>15%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Community Involvement &amp; Accessibility</td>
              <td>10%</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Alabama State Bar standing is a pass/fail prerequisite&mdash;any attorney who does not meet this requirement is automatically excluded regardless of other scores. The remaining five criteria are scored on a 1&ndash;10 scale and weighted according to the table above to produce an overall ranking score.</p>

        <h2>Independence &amp; No Pay-for-Placement</h2>
        <p>Our rankings are editorially independent. <strong>No attorney or law firm can pay to be listed, promoted, or ranked higher on our site.</strong> We do not accept sponsored placements within our top 10 list. Our revenue model is based on connecting interested individuals with attorneys through our contact form&mdash;not on selling ranking positions.</p>
        <p>If an attorney featured on our list contacts us to request removal, we will honor that request. If a member of the public believes an attorney on our list should be reconsidered, they may <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with specific, verifiable information.</p>

        <h2>Update Schedule</h2>
        <p>We review and update our rankings on a semi-annual basis. Our current schedule:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li><strong>January 2025:</strong> Full review and publication of the 2025 Edition (current).</li>
          <li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Mid-year review to account for any significant changes (new disciplinary actions, firm closures, major award announcements, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>January 2026:</strong> Full annual re-evaluation and publication of the 2026 Edition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Between scheduled reviews, we may make interim updates if we become aware of material changes to an attorney's standing, such as a public disciplinary action by the Alabama State Bar.</p>

        <h2>Limitations &amp; Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>While we strive for thoroughness and accuracy, our methodology has inherent limitations:</p>
        <ul style="list-style:disc;padding-left:25px;margin:15px 0;">
          <li>Our review is based on publicly available information. We do not have access to private case files, non-public disciplinary proceedings, or confidential settlement details.</li>
          <li>Online reviews, while useful, can be subject to bias. We attempt to identify and discount potentially inauthentic reviews, but no system is perfect.</li>
          <li>Our rankings reflect the Huntsville and Madison County market specifically. An attorney who is excellent but primarily serves a different geographic area may not appear on our list.</li>
          <li>This is an informational directory, not legal advice. Our rankings do not constitute an endorsement or guarantee of any attorney's performance on any specific case.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions About Our Methodology?</h2>
