By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Site.</p>

          <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>By accessing, browsing, or using the Site in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, and your continued use of the Site following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for updates.</p>

          <h2>2. Attorney Advertising Disclaimer</h2>
          <p><strong>IMPORTANT: THIS WEBSITE CONSTITUTES ATTORNEY ADVERTISING.</strong> The content on this Site is provided for general informational purposes and should be considered advertising material under the rules of the Alabama State Bar and applicable rules of professional conduct.</p>
          <p>The attorneys and law firms featured on this Site have been selected based on publicly available information, including professional achievements, client reviews, and community reputation. Inclusion on this Site does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or certification of any attorney&rsquo;s qualifications, competence, or quality of legal services. The selection criteria used do not reflect a comprehensive evaluation and should not be the sole basis for selecting legal representation.</p>
          <p>No representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Past results do not guarantee or predict a similar outcome in any future case. Every legal matter is different, and the outcome of any particular case depends on a variety of factors unique to that case.</p>

          <h2>3. No Legal Advice</h2>
          <p>The information provided on this Site, including articles, blog posts, attorney profiles, practice area descriptions, and all other content, is intended for general informational purposes only. <strong>Nothing on this Site constitutes legal advice, nor is it intended to be a substitute for legal advice from a qualified, licensed attorney.</strong></p>
          <p>You should not act or refrain from acting based on any information on this Site without first seeking professional legal counsel. Legal matters are highly fact-specific, and the applicability of laws and regulations may vary based on your individual circumstances, jurisdiction, and the specific facts of your situation. Always consult with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction before making any legal decisions.</p>

          <p><strong>No attorney-client relationship is created by your use of this Site.</strong> Accessing or using the Site, sending an email or message through the Site, or submitting a contact form does not establish an attorney-client relationship between you and Top 10 Huntsville Lawyers, or between you and any attorney or law firm listed on the Site.</p>
          <p>An attorney-client relationship is only formed through a formal, written agreement between you and a specific attorney or law firm. Do not send confidential or sensitive information through this Site unless and until an attorney-client relationship has been established through a signed engagement agreement with a specific attorney.</p>
          <p>Any information you submit through the Site prior to establishing an attorney-client relationship is not protected by attorney-client privilege and may not be treated as confidential.</p>
